							<h2>1st Place Poster Winner in Math and Computer Science: National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium (NJSHS)</h2>
							<p>Discovered a method to activate both semantic organization and episodic memory neural networks in the brain. Developed an autonomous algorithm to determine when stimulation should be applied based on adaptive criteria, effectively reversing irreversible memory issues by 86%. This memory treatment is patient-specific, recovering seemingly lost memory events by targeting electrical stimulation towards the brain every 0.5 seconds in a closed-loop stimulation system.</p>

									<h2>Abstract World 🖼️</h2>
									<p>Progressing into my Senior Year, I have started to enjoy the simplicities in life I never really cared about. My interests in research have changed as well; Instead of just trying to find "novel" results, I began to try to understand biological functions and reasonings behind each of my results, whether they are new or old findings.</p>
